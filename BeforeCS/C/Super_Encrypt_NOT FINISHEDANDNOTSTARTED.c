// day somthing ( i stop tracking since i was procrastinating lol)
// for the c project, i want to do something cybersecruity related, which being a encrypt and decrypt
// program. I wanted to do this as i wanted to see the perspective of a randsomware attack from the attackers side
// from developing a crypt, implementing it to a file, thne decrypting it with a key.
// With research, there are practical ways of doing this, such as openssl, but i would like to only use
// the libaries that come with gcc/gnu to develop the ciper as so forth.
// I will be using a xor stream cipher
// OK IM COMING BACK TO THIS WHEN I ACTUALLY THINK THIS THROUGH.
